The main difference between an int and Integer

Integer is an object
int is a reference

Integer can call different built-in methods. Variables of Integer store references to Integer objects
int stores integer value in memory

int cannot cast a string value (even if it contains an integer) to an int variable
Integer can cast by assigning string to object of Integer Type using the Integer(String) constructor

you use int when declaring reference. int is not an actual integer. 
Ex) int a is a reference where 'a' is pointing to Integer.

Integer object can converts its value to other bases. For Ex) Integer can convert toBinaryString(), 
toOctalString(), toHexString(), etc.
int can not convert
